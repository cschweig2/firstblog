My favorite vacation destination is the **Big Island of Hawaii**. I know, it sounds cliche, but the Big Island is a truly beautiful and ecologically diverse place. They have snow on top of their tallest mountain, active volcanoes, desert, rainforests, and beauitful black sand beaches. The hiking and snorkeling opportunities are endless and the food is _delicious_. Here are my favorite destinations on the Big Island:

- Downtown Hawi
  >Hawi is a beautiful small down with restaurants and shops. It has a more "local" feel and is located near Pololu Valley where you can hike down to the black sand beach. Keep an eye out for a man selling coconuts out of his truck when you hike back up for a much needed re*fresh*ment.
- Volcanoes National Park
  >This national park is extremely unique for those who crave adventure. Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park protects some of the most unique geological, biological, and cultural landscapes in the world. Extending from sea level to 13,677 feet, the park encompasses the summits of two of the world's most active volcanoes - Kīlauea and Mauna Loa. 
- Captain Cook Monument
  >At the Captain Cook monument you will find an excellent snorkeling destination. Plenty of sea critters on and around the coral, maybe a shark or two, and if you're lucky, you might even see a school of dolphins! You can hike down for a real adventure, or you can take the _easy_ way and kayak to the spot. But who really wants to do that?
